PenguinMenaceEngine
===================

A 3d game engine (slightly focused on space shooters)

In src/test/java there are classes to demonstrate how to initialize and use the game engine.

I hope that the rest is obvious from the JavaDoc, if not I will not blame you for asking me in a kind message. (I would also apreciate if you tell me what you think of the engine)

Due to the lack of time, I will not make any changes at the code for some time. However, if you present yourself trustworth, i will give you commit permission.
